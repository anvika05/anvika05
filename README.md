## Projects

### AI Studio — Upcoming Collaborative ML Fellowship with Industry Partner
As part of Break Through Tech's AI/ML Fellowship, I’ll participate in a team-based collaboration with industry partners to tackle real-world business problems using machine learning. Matched with a company that aligns with my skills and interests, I’ll work with large-scale datasets to develop, test, and evaluate predictive models aimed at delivering impactful solutions.

### [DISCOver](https://devpost.com/software/discover-tvb5z0) — Assistive Chrome Extension for Accessibility
As part of a team project focused on inclusive technology, I helped develop DISCOver, a Chrome extension designed to make web browsing more accessible for users with dyslexia and other visual processing challenges. The tool allows users to personalize website appearance—adjusting font size, font style, and background color—for a more comfortable and readable experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, DISCOver was our first venture into browser extension development, and we successfully deployed and tested it through Repl.it. Our goal was to bridge accessibility gaps and empower all users to navigate the web with ease.
